[2025-06-06 05:34:40] [hewwo_berry]: UNO - Every 3 wins is a point 

TSB - You have to specifically challenge a player on the server, and winner gets a point. You can only get 2 points from winning from someone. Ex. Once you fight me twice and you win both, that's 2 points, but you can't fight me anymore. If you are challenged you can always deny or try to fight and get the point.

JJS - You have to specifically challenge a player on the server, and winner gets a point. You can only get 2 points from winning from someone. Ex. Once you fight me twice and you win both, that's 2 points, but you can't fight me anymore. If you are challenged you can always deny or try to fight and get the point.

Forsaken - Every 3 killer rounds won is a point, every 5 survivor rounds is a point. The wins donâ€™t have to be consecutive.

Deadrails - normal game mode: Every 3 wins is a point. Scorched earth: every 2 wins is a point.

Murder Mystery 2 - Every 3 non killer wins is a point. Every 2 killer wins is a point.

Apeirophobia  - Every completed chapter is a point.

Doors - Whole game completed is 2 points. 

**THESE GAMES ARE THE CURRENT AVAILABLE LIST. THIS LIST CAN CHANGE TO ACCOMADATE MORE GAMES OR REMOVE CERTAIN GAMES. DM <@Berry, I don't feel bad.>  if you would like to quickly ask for a game. These games were picked on how known they are, and how easy getting proof for the objective. The amount of points for each game were decided and how hard it is to get the points. These are not final and can be changed**

_There are 3 ways I recommend to hard proof the objectives, get in a call with or call me to watch you get the objective, Screenshot of you getting the objective, or recording you getting the objective_ **If you would like to participate and u still have not submitted on the form, dm me immediately before trying to earn any points.**

A @ everyone ping will be set out tmr, as I don't want to annoy anyone on this evening.
