[2025-06-06 05:34:40] [hewwo_berry]: UNO - Every 3 wins is a point 

TSB - You have to specifically challenge a player on the server, and winner gets a point. You can only get 2 points from winning from someone. Ex. Once you fight me twice and you win both, that's 2 points, but you can't fight me anymore. If you are challenged you can always deny or try to fight and get the point.

JJS - You have to specifically challenge a player on the server, and winner gets a point. You can only get 2 points from winning from someone. Ex. Once you fight me twice and you win both, that's 2 points, but you can't fight me anymore. If you are challenged you can always deny or try to fight and get the point.

Forsaken - Every 3 killer rounds won is a point, every 5 survivor rounds is a point. The wins don’t have to be consecutive.

Deadrails - normal game mode: Every 3 wins is a point. Scorched earth: every 2 wins is a point.

Murder Mystery 2 - Every 3 non killer wins is a point. Every 2 killer wins is a point.

Apeirophobia  - Every completed chapter is a point.

Doors - Whole game completed is 2 points. 

**THESE GAMES ARE THE CURRENT AVAILABLE LIST. THIS LIST CAN CHANGE TO ACCOMADATE MORE GAMES OR REMOVE CERTAIN GAMES. DM <@Berry, I don't feel bad.>  if you would like to quickly ask for a game. These games were picked on how known they are, and how easy getting proof for the objective. The amount of points for each game were decided and how hard it is to get the points. These are not final and can be changed**

_There are 3 ways I recommend to hard proof the objectives, get in a call with or call me to watch you get the objective, Screenshot of you getting the objective, or recording you getting the objective_ **If you would like to participate and u still have not submitted on the form, dm me immediately before trying to earn any points.**

A @ everyone ping will be set out tmr, as I don't want to annoy anyone on this evening.
[2025-06-06 13:53:39] [hewwo_berry]: @everyone One last pjng for me. Finding a variety of skilled base games takes time it suppose so I will just move the tournament start date to around next week saturday, plus new details on time, there was lbe most likely more games, if anything arises, and it can't be done next week,il just move it to   around July. This shit is more complicated than I thought
[2025-06-06 21:30:25] [hewwo_berry]: This is a skill-based Roblox tournament that will run for about a month. Before each round, I’ll announce in advance which game will be played and when the private server will be hosted. Everyone in the tournament will get the server link and will need to join at the scheduled time. Each round will be a different skill-based game, like Tower of Hell, Arsenal, or something similar. The goal changes depending on the game—for example, being one of the first three to finish an obby or getting the most kills in a match. If you hit the round’s goal, you get a point. At the end of the tournament, whoever has the most points wins. And let’s be clear: if you try to cheat, you’re not being clever—you’re just being a dick. If you're caught cheating, you’ll either lose points or get kicked the fuck out of the tournament, no second chances.

**The month the tournament is going to be is not decided yet, and will be told, once enough games are found.**
[2025-06-06 21:33:09] [hewwo_berry]: `**ALL RESPONSES CURRENTLY ARE IGNORED DUE TO THE FACT THE TOURNAMENT STYLE  HAS CHANGED, SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD A GAME / JOIN. PLEASE RESUBMIT**`4
